I've decided to apply the Luhn algorithm using JavaScript in an attempt to learn how it can be applied to more modern frameworks
From what I've read there is a couple minor issues with this algorithm regarding number duplicates such as 22 <-> 55, and
it also has an issue with very few transposed numbers as well.
Some companies decided to use slight variants of this algorithm such as the Damm algorithm which do not have these same issues.
The Luhn algorithm cannot be applied to social security numbers, but can be found true with most identification numbers. Such as telephone IMEI tags.
